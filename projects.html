    <h2>This Website</h2>
    <p class="spacer">
        The website you are currently viewing is a long term project I have to one, bring back geo-cities, and two,
        showcase what I have learned in HTML, CSS and potentially JS. I have found that the number one way to keep up
        and remember what you have learned is by making projects, so this website will continue to be updated with new
        links and projects as I continue to make more cool and fun stuff!</p>

    <h2>C# Console Calculator</h2>
    <p class="spacer">
        On my Github, you will find a repo for a C# console calculator that I wrote. The program itself is pretty
        straight-forward and doesn't allow for super advanced math, but it saves all your inputs to an array so you are
        able to choose however many numbers you need for your calculations. It also includes a FizzBuzz functionality,
        where it prints the numbers 1 through 100 and lets you know whether or not the number is divisible by three,
        five, or both three and five. I added this because it shows that I can use logic and get the intended result.

    <h2>Wrestling Graphs</h2>
    <p class="spacer">
        These programs are python programs that show off the attendance for both All Elite Wrestling (AEW) and World
        Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) Pay-Per-View attendance numbers. A lot of the code in these programs was written
        when I had minimal knowledge of Python and as such, I have put these programs on the back burner while I
        continue to learn python so I can fully rewrite the code.</p>

    <h1 class="welcome">freeCodeCamp Projects</h1>
    <p class="spacer">
        During my time going through freeCodeCamp and completing all the projects on the site, I realized that if I do
        not have any workplace or real world experience, the best thing I can do is add the projects to my portfolio
        website. The next few projects are all projects that I have built while going through freeCodeCamp.

    <h2>RPG Game</h2>
    <p class="spacer">
        This is the first major JavaScript project I wrote while working through freeCodeCamp. It is a JavaScript RPG
        game. You are able to buy health, buy weapons, and fight different creatures.
