        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>Hello and welcome to my website! I hope you enjoy your stay here!
            My name is Brian. I am 25 years old and live in Connecticut.
            I have many interests but my main interests are anything Disney,
            Stand-up comedy, and programming. I have always been interested
            in programming for as long as I can remember. For my High School
            graduation project, I learned the basics of Java to code a calculator
            but I ended up abandoning the project after graduating.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating since I didn't want to go to college yet, I found work
            part time in a movie theater, this was back in 2017.
            Fast forward to current day, I am learning Java, Python, C#, HTML and CSS
            on my own through multiple different sources.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far, I have completed both the Beginner and Advanced Java courses offered by the University of Helsinki,
            I have completed the Foundational C# course on freeCodeCamp and MicrosoftLearn, and more which can be <a
