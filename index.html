        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Brian Coppola. I am a web dev based out of Connecticut USA. I am fully self taught, with
            freeCodeCamp being the source of most of my knowledge supplemented with Youtube and other random solo
            projects. My eventual goal is to be able to do what I love full time while also being able to work on
            freelance projects on the side.</p>

    <section id="projects">
        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>Currently, my projects that I have uploaded can be found <a
                href="https://github.com/therealthrithral"><strong>here on my GitHub.</strong></a> I am currently in the
            process of updating the projects page to better reflect my projects, as well as getting
            them all committed to GitHub. When that is complete, this section will link there as well.</p>
